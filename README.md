## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- Removed ~2% duplicate records.  
- Handled ~5% missing values using **mean imputation**.  
- Categorical encoding for `category`, `device`, `country`.  
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**.  
- Engineered features:
  - **Engagement Rate:** `(likes + comments) / views`  
  - **Avg Watch Time per View:** `watch_time_minutes / views`  

---

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized distributions and outliers for `views`, `likes`, `comments`, `watch_time_minutes`, `video_length_minutes`, `subscribers`.  
- Examined correlation matrix to identify key revenue drivers.  
- Boxplots and violin plots to detect outliers and trends.
